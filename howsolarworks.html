			<h3>Solar panels</h3>
			<p>A solar panel is used to convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles 
			of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads. 
			Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are made up of many solar cells. Solar cells are made of 
			silicon, like semiconductors. They are constructed with a positive layer and a negative 
			layer, which together create an electric field, just like in a battery. The more light that 
			hits a cell, the more electricity it produces.
			</p>
			</aside>
			
			<aside class="box2">
			<h3>Charge controller</h3>
			<p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array.
			It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day, and that the power 
			doesn’t run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers 
			are available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is
			its primary job. It should be noted that charge controllers only control DC loads. AC loads are to be 
			controlled (and disconnected, if needed) by an inverter.
			</p>
			</aside>
			
			<aside class="box3">
			<h3>Battery system</h3>
			<p>Solar batteries work by storing energy produced by solar panels for later use. The higher 
			your battery's capacity, the more solar energy it can store. When you install a solar battery 
			as part of your solar panel system, you are able to store excess solar electricity at your home 
			instead of sending it back to the grid. If your solar panels are producing more electricity than 
			you need, the excess energy goes towards charging the battery. Later, when your solar panels 
			aren’t producing electricity, you can draw down the energy you stored earlier in your battery for 
			night use.

			<h3>DC power</h3>
			<p>Direct Current (DC) Power refers to the unidirectional flow of electrons and is the form of 
			power that is most commonly produced by sources such as solar cells and batteries. In DC current, 
			the electrons move from an area of negative charge to an area of positive charge without changing 
			direction. Solar panels use the photons produced by sunlight to generate direct current (DC) 
			electricity. When the photons hit the panel they are absorbed by the panel’s semiconducting silicon 
			material. During this process electrons separate from the atoms and move around the solar cell. 
			</p>
			</aside>
		
			<aside class="box5">
			<h3>Inverter</h3>
			<p>The solar powered inverter is the electrical converter type that can convert the variable 
			direct current (DC) power into the utility frequency usable alternating current (AC) power.In 
			the absence of solar inverter, we can receive energy from the sun into the solar panel, but we 
			cannot use that collected solar energy into our home appliances, electronics, and lightings.The
			solar inverter is an essential part of the whole solar PV system, and this is also the part most 
			likely to have issues as they are located in different weather conditions such as humidity, 
			extreme heat, and rain.
			</p>
			</aside>
		
			<aside class="box6">
			<h3>AC power</h3>
			<p>Alternating current (AC) is an electric current that periodically reverses its direction, 
			in contrast to direct current (DC) which only flows in a single direction which cannot change
			sporadically. his is usually caused by a sinusoidally varying current and voltage that reverses
			directions, creating a periodic back and forth motion for the current. Despite this current 
			flowing back and forth many times a second, the energy still essentially flows continuously from 
			the power plant to the electronic devices.
